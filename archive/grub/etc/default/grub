# identifies the Nth entry in the generated menu counted from zero,

# Unless 'GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY' is set to 'true', two menu entries
# will be generated for each Linux kernel: one default entry and one
# entry for recovery mode.  This option lists command-line arguments
# to add only to the default menu entry, after those listed in

# '0' to boot immediately without displaying the menu, or to '-1' to
# wait indefinitely

# Select the terminal output device.  You may select multiple devices

#
# Valid terminal output names depend on the platform, but may include
# 'console' (native platform console), 'serial' (serial terminal),
# 'serial_<port>' (serial terminal with explicit port selection),
# 'gfxterm' (graphics-mode output), 'vga_text' (VGA text output),
# 'mda_text' (MDA text output), 'morse' (Morse-coding using system
# beeper) or 'spkmodem' (simple data protocol using system speaker).
# The default is to use the platform's native terminal output.
#
# Please check the documentation for setting an output device.
#GRUB_TERMINAL="console"

# Set the resolution used on the 'gfxterm' graphical terminal.  Note
# that you can only use modes which your graphics card supports via
# VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE), so for example native LCD panel
# resolutions may not be available.  The default is 'auto', which
# tries to select a preferred resolution.
#
#   The resolution may be specified as a sequence of one or more modes,
# separated by commas (',') or semicolons (';'); each will be tried in
# turn until one is found.  Each mode should be either 'auto',
# 'WIDTHxHEIGHT', or 'WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH'.
