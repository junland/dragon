Dragora is a reliable GNU/Linux-Libre distribution based on the concept of simplicity with the goal of being a multi-purpose operating system. Dragora respects the freedom of the user with the values of free software and provides control to those who use it. It is developed entirely by volunteers and it is published under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Dragora is a combination of the GNU project with the releases of the Linux kernel provided by the Linux-libre project.

Linux is a fundamental piece of the distribution written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with the collaboration of thousands of users and developers around the world.

The GNU project is a free software project of massive collaboration, announced on September 27th, 1983 by Richard Stallman.

Linux-libre is a project whose aim is maintaining and releasing 100% free distributions of Linux, appropriate to be used in free distributions. It removes software that gets included without source code, with obfuscated source code, or with nonfree licenses; this does not allow the user to modify the software to make it do whatever the user want, which makes the user install additional pieces of nonfree software.
