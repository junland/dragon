Version 2021Dec31 released.

    * Binutils has been upgraded to the release 2.35.2.
      It contains latest changes from 2_35-branch (up to commit 3437a8b).

    * Kernel headers from Linux-libre 5.10.56.

    * GCC 10.3.1 (from snapshot 10-20211224).

      - GMP 6.2.1.

      - MPFR 4.1.0 + cumulative patch (latest update from 2021-02-11).

      - MPC 1.2.1.

      - ISL 0.24.

    * Musl upgraded to release 1.2.2+ (up to commit 98e688a).

    * Targets:

      - i486: Added.  This is an Intel 486 target optimized for Intel 686
        (or superior) processors.

      - i586: The default target name has been changed to "i586-linux-musl"
        instead of "i386-linux-musl" to be more specific.

      - mips: This now passes or uses the "--with-linker-hash-style=sysv"
        option for GCC by default.

    * The code in darkcrusade (script) has been improved.
      Relevant changes are:

      - Better handling in case of errors, the script now stops if an error occurs.

      - Output directory creation on build is now composed using
        yearNumber+monthName+dayNumber plus shell's parent ID (e.g:
        "phase2-i586-2021-12-31.085911-21007").

    * Minor changes.

2019-09-24 Matias A. Fonzo <selk@dragora.org>

Version 2019Sep24 released.

    * GCC-9-20190921 (from snapshot, post gcc-9.2.0).

      - GMP 6.1.2.

      - MPFR 4.0.2 + cumulative patch (latest update: 2019-06-02).

      - MPC 1.1.0.

    * Musl updated to the snapshot 20190913_f5eee489 (post musl-1.1.23).

    * Targets:

        armv7-a:

        - This soft float target has been renamed to 'armv7a_fp'.

        - The CPU name for the target triplet has been changed to be more
          generic (from armv7a to arm).

        armv7a_hf:

        - New target added.  This is almost the same target as 'armv7a_fp'
          with the difference that this target is hard float, plus FPU
          'vfpv3-d16'.

        armv7hl:

        - New target added.  This is a hard float target for the armv7-a
          architecture (hard float) but with the FPU tuned for 'neon'.

        i586:

        - The option --enable-cld for the CLD instruction is now used by
          default (just in case).

        powerpc:

        - Option for decimal support has been disabled here.

        powerpc64:

        - The option --with-abi=elfv2 is now passed by default (just in case).

        - The target name has been renamed to 'powerpc64le' for clarification.

        riscv64:

        - New target added with multilib support.  This is a hard float target
          for the architecture 'rv64gc' with the ABI 'lp64d'.

        s390x:

        - Directory to look into the corresponding (kernel) headers for the
          architecture has been fixed. (s390x -> s390).

    * Toolchain:

      - Option for binutils --disable-separate-code is now given by default.
        See: https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2019/08/12/4

      - Patches for GCC has been updated to work against Musl, GCC-9.
        Thanks to Szabolcs Nagy for provide it.  :-)

      - config.sub and config.guess have been updated in order to detect more
        target triplets, for example those containing "armv7hl"...

    * Darkcrusade is now distributed using the tarlz format.  For more
      information, visit https://lzip.nongnu.org/tarlz.html

    * Minor changes.
