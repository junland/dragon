Version 2019Sep24 released.

    * Binutils 2.32 + updates from 2_32-branch (version: 20190914).

    * Linux-libre 4.19.75 (headers).

    * GCC-9-20190921 (from snapshot, post gcc-9.2.0).

      - GMP 6.1.2.

      - MPFR 4.0.2 + cumulative patch (latest update: 2019-06-02).

      - MPC 1.1.0.

    * Musl updated to the snapshot 20190913_f5eee489 (post musl-1.1.23).

    * Targets:

        armv7-a:

        - This soft float target has been renamed to 'armv7a_fp'.

        - The CPU name for the target triplet has been changed to be more
          generic (from armv7a to arm).

        armv7a_hf:

        - New target added.  This is almost the same target as 'armv7a_fp'
          with the difference that this target is hard float, plus FPU
          'vfpv3-d16'.

        armv7hl:

        - New target added.  This is a hard float target for the armv7-a
          architecture (hard float) but with the FPU tuned for 'neon'.

        i586:

        - The option --enable-cld for the CLD instruction is now used by
          default (just in case).

        powerpc:

        - Option for decimal support has been disabled here.

        powerpc64:

        - The option --with-abi=elfv2 is now passed by default (just in case).

        - The target name has been renamed to 'powerpc64le' for clarification.

        riscv64:

        - New target added with multilib support.  This is a hard float target
          for the architecture 'rv64gc' with the ABI 'lp64d'.

        s390x:

        - Directory to look into the corresponding (kernel) headers for the
          architecture has been fixed. (s390x -> s390).

    * Toolchain:

      - Option for binutils --disable-separate-code is now given by default.
        See: http://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2019/08/12/4

      - Patches for GCC has been updated to work against Musl, GCC-9.
        Thanks to Szabolcs Nagy for provide it.  :-)

      - config.sub and config.guess have been updated in order to detect more
        target triplets, for example those containing "armv7hl"...

    * Darkcrusade is now distributed using the tarlz format.  For more
      information, visit http://lzip.nongnu.org/tarlz.html

    * Minor changes.
