    * Version 1.5 (stable to be released).

    * install: Fix assignation of 'rootdir' when it is empty and it
      relies on the value of 'targetdir' when runs a post-install script.

    * doc: Fix examples for 'rootdir' since the package directory and
      the target directory are relative to the specified root directory.

    * Use the power of awk(1) to display package descriptions.

    * The pkgbase() function for printing the package name has been simplified.

    * Minor changes.

    * Version 1.4 released.

    * build: Added support for optional "package category".  If the
      variable 'pkgcategory' is declared in a recipe, Qi will produce
      packages ala "<name>-<version>-<architecture>+release@category".

    * general: The configuration file is now included instead of being
      analyzed.  This is to have more room to declare things in general.

    * build: The 'arch' value is used as suffix for produced packages
      in order to have a well-organized (per-arch) output directory,
      e.g:
       /var/cache/qi/packages/noarch/
       /var/cache/qi/packages/i586/
       /var/cache/qi/packages/x86_64/
       ...

    * The code of blacklisted packages in the updates has been simplified.

    * doc: The "Variables from the environment" section has been improved.

    * build: The 'full_pkgname' variable is now added on the meta tag file.

    * doc: The manual has been updated to conform to this version.

    * Minor changes.

    * Version 1.3 released.

    * Check the exit status when a recipe is imported or included.
      This will help to catch possible errors when using shell code,
      rather than proceeding with the recipe.

    * Minor changes.

    * Version 1.2 released.

    * The variable 'arch' has been added to the package meta file,
      additionally, the variables 'program' and 'version' has been
      replaced with 'pkgname' and 'pkgversion' which take the value
      of those if they have not been previously established.

    * Minor changes.

2019-05-19  Matias Fonzo  <selk@dragora.org>

    * Version 1.1 released.

    * Default external tool for uncompressing files based on .tar.lz
      archives has been changed in the unpack() function from tarlz(1) to
      lzip(1) in combination with tar(1).  This is because some files
      could have been produced using a header format that differs from the
      default format used by tarlz(1), e.g. the GNU format (by GNU tar).

    * Some phrases have been improved in the manual, under the section
      "5.3 Writing recipes".  Thanks to kelsoo.

2019-04-15  Matias Fonzo  <selk@dragora.org>

    * Version 1.0 (stable) released.

    * The manual (user guide) has been updated.
