    * Check the output status when a recipe is imported (or included).
      This will help catch any possible errors when using shell code,
      rather than proceeding with the recipe.

    * Minor changes.

    * The variable 'arch' has been added to the package meta file,
      additionally, the variables 'program' and 'version' has been
      replaced with 'pkgname' and 'pkgversion' which take the value
      of those if they have not been previously established.

    * Minor changes.

    * Default external tool for uncompressing files based on .tar.lz
      archives has been changed in the unpack() function from tarlz(1) to
      lzip(1) in combination with tar(1).  This is because some files
      could have been produced using a header format that differs from the
      default format used by tarlz(1), e.g. the GNU format (by GNU tar).

    * Some phrases have been improved in the manual, under the section
      "5.3 Writing recipes".  Thanks to kelsoo.

    * Version 1.0 (stable) released.

    * The manual (user guide) has been updated.
