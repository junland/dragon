    * Default external tool for uncompressing files based on .tar.lz
      archives has been changed in the unpack() function from tarlz(1) to
      lzip(1) in combination with tar(1).  This is because some files
      could have been produced using a header format that differs from the
      default format used by tarlz(1), e.g. the GNU format (by GNU tar).

    * Some phrases have been improved in the manual, under the section
      "5.3 Writing recipes".  Thanks to kelsoo.
