  1. Introduction.

Qi is a source builder and a package manager:

   It contains a set of (individual) tools to build, install, remove,
and upgrade software packages.  It follows the philosophy of simplicity
without adding too many features, such as those that can be found in
popular package managers.  Basically it does two things: builds
packages and manages them.

   Qi constructs the sources using recipe names, files that contain
specific instructions to build every source.  As result, a binary
package is obtained which can be installed, removed, upgraded, or
inspected in the system.

   The packages are managed thanks to an external tool called
_graft(1)_, which provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages
under a single directory hierarchy, it was inspired by both Depot
(Carnegie Mellon University) and Stow (Bob Glickstein).  In this
aspect, Qi complements Graft: it can work with packages, check them,
solve conflicts, and more...

  2. Installation.

Requirements:

- A POSIX-compliant shell.

- Graft: http://peters.gormand.com.au/Home/tools

    Perl (http://www.perl.org) is required in order to run graft(1).

                                  Note
    Take into account when graft is installed, you can define some
    macros like PACKAGEDIR and TARGETDIR.  To be consistent use the
    same paths when `configure', adjusting it via --packagedir and
    --targetdir options.  If you have not changed the default values
    used on the graft installation, you can avoid these steps, since
    Qi uses the same values for PACKAGEDIR and TARGETDIR of graft.

- Tarlz: http://lzip.nongnu.org/tarlz.html

- A mktemp(1) implementation (normally included on your system):
  http://www.mktemp.org

To configure, make and install qi, type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

See `./configure --help' for more options.

To install in a different location, DESTDIR is supported.  This is
useful for package distributors:

  $ make DESTDIR=/tmp/qi install
