  1. Introduction.

Qi is a simple but well-integrated package manager.  It can creates,
install, remove, and upgrade software packages.  Qi produces binary
packages using recipe names, these are files containing specific
instructions to build every source.  Qi can manage multiple packages
under a single directory hierarchy, this method allows to maintain a set
of packages and multiple versions of them.  This means that Qi could be
used as the main package manager or complement the existing one.

   Qi offers a friendly command line interface, a global configuration
file, a simple recipe layout to deploy software packages; also works
with binary packages in parallel, speeding up installations and packages
in production.  The used format for packages is a simplified but safe
POSIX pax archive compressed with lzip.

   Qi is a modern (POSIX-compliant) shell script released under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  There are only two major
dependencies for the magic: graft(1) and tarlz(1), the rest is expected
to be found in any Unix-like system.

  2. Installation.

Requirements:

- A POSIX-compliant shell.

- Graft: http://peters.gormand.com.au/Home/tools

    Perl (http://www.perl.org) is required in order to run graft(1).

                                  Note
    Take into account when graft is installed, you can define some
    macros like PACKAGEDIR and TARGETDIR.  To be consistent use the
    same paths when `configure', adjusting it via --packagedir and
    --targetdir options.  If you have not changed the default values
    used on the graft installation, you can avoid these steps, since
    qi uses the same graft values for PACKAGEDIR and TARGETDIR.

- Tarlz: http://lzip.nongnu.org/tarlz.html

- A mktemp(1) implementation (normally included in the system):
  http://www.mktemp.org

To configure, make and install qi, type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

See `./configure --help' for more options.

To install in a different location, DESTDIR is supported.  This is useful
for package distributors:

  $ make DESTDIR=/tmp/qi install
