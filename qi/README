  1. Introduction.

Qi is a source builder and a package manager:

   It contains a set of (individual) tools to build, install, remove,
and upgrade software packages.  It follows the philosophy of simplicity
without adding too many features, such as those that can be found in
popular package managers.  Basically it does two things: builds
packages and manages them.

   Qi constructs the sources using recipe names, files that contain
specific instructions to build every source.  As result, a binary
package is obtained which can be installed, removed, upgraded, or
inspected in the system.

   The packages are managed thanks to an external tool called
_graft(1)_, which provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages
under a single directory hierarchy, it was inspired by both Depot
(Carnegie Mellon University) and Stow (Bob Glickstein).  In this
aspect, Qi complements Graft: it can work with packages, check them,
solve conflicts, and more...

  2. Installation.

Requirements:

- A (POSIX) compatible shell.

- Graft: http://peters.gormand.com.au/Home/tools

    Perl (http://www.perl.org) is required in order to run graft(1).

    Take into account when graft is installed, you can define some
    macros like PACKAGEDIR and TARGETDIR.  To be consistent, use the
    same paths when `configure'.

- Lzip: http://lzip.nongnu.org

- A mktemp(1) implementation: http://www.mktemp.org

To configure, make and install qi, type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

See `./configure --help' for more information.

To install in a different location, DESTDIR is supported.  This is
useful for package distributors:

  $ make DESTDIR=/tmp/qi install
