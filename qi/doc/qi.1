.SH DESCRIPTION
Qi is a simple but well\-integrated package manager.  It can create,
install, remove, and upgrade software packages.  Qi produces binary
packages using recipes, which are files containing specific instructions
to build each package from source.  Qi can manage multiple packages
under a single directory hierarchy.  This method allows to maintain a
set of packages and multiple versions of them.  This means that Qi could
be used as the main package manager or complement the existing one.
