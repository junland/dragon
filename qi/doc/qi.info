1 Introduction
**************

Qi is a simple but well-integrated package manager.  It can creates,
install, remove, and upgrade software packages.  Qi produces binary
packages using recipe names, these are files containing specific
instructions to build every source.  Qi can manage multiple packages
under a single directory hierarchy, this method allows to maintain a set
of packages and multiple versions of them.  This means that Qi could be
used as the main package manager or complement the existing one.

   Qi offers a friendly command line interface, a global configuration
file, a simple recipe layout to deploy software packages; also works
with binary packages in parallel, speeding up installations and packages
in production.  The used format for packages is a simplified but safe
POSIX pax archive compressed with lzip.

   Qi is a modern (POSIX-compliant) shell script released under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  There are only two major
dependencies for the magic: graft(1) and tarlz(1), the rest is expected
to be found in any Unix-like system.

2 Invoking qi
*************

This chapter describes the synopsis and command line options for invoke
Qi.

     Usage: qi [OPTION]... [FILE]...

One mandatory option specifies the operation that 'qi' should perform,
other options are meant to detail how this operation should be
performed.

qi supports the following options to operate:

'-b'
     Build package using recipe names.

'-c'
     Create .tlz package from directory.

'-d'
     Delete packages.

'-i'
     Install packages.

'-o'
     Resolve build order through .order files.

'-u'
     Update packages (implies -i, -d and -p options).

'-w'
     Warn about files that will be linked.

'-x'
     Extract a package for debugging purposes.

There are common options between modes:

'-N'
     Do not read the configuration file.

     This will omit any value on the qirc file.

'-P <DIR>'
     Package directory for installations.

     This option sets '${packagedir}'.

     Only valid for -i, -d, or -u options.

'-f'
     Force option.

     This can force the build of a recipe, or update a pre-existing
     package.

     Only valid for -b, -u options.

'-t <DIR>'
     Target directory for symbolic links.

     This option sets '${targetdir}'.

     Only valid for -i, -d, or -u options.

'-k'
     Keep (don't delete) '${srcdir}' or '${destdir}' on build mode.

     Keep (don't delete) package directory on delete mode.

     Only valid for -b, -d or -u options.

'-p'
     Prune conflicts on package installations.

     This option may proceed with the package installation if one or
     more conflicts occur.

'-r /rootdir'
     Use the fully qualified named directory as the root directory for
     all qi operations.  The target directory and package directory will
     be relative to the specified directory.

'-v'
     Be verbose (a 2nd -v gives more).

Options for build mode (-b):

'-O <DIR>'
     Where the produced packages are written.

     This option sets '${outdir}'.

'-W <DIR>'
     Where archives, patches, and recipes are expected.

     This option sets '${worktree}'.

'-Z <DIR>'
     Where (compressed) sources will be found.

     This option sets '${tardir}'.

'-a'
     Architecture to use.

     Default value is obtained via uname(1) as 'uname -m'.

'-j'
     Parallel jobs for the compiler.

     If not specified, default sets to 1.

'-1'
     Increment release number ('${release}' + 1).

     It will be omitted if the -n option is being used.

'-n'
     Don't create a .tlz package.

'-S'
     Selects the option to skip completed recipes.

     This means, in interactive mode, when the dialog to summarize
     recipes is showed.

Informative options:

'-L'
     Print default directory locations.

     This will print the target directory, package directory, working
     tree, the directory for tarballs, and the output directory for
     produced packages.

'-h'
     Display the help describing the options and then exit.

'-V'
     Print the version number and license information.  The version
     number should be included in all bug reports.

Expected arguments beyond of options are package directories and regular
files: recipes or files ending in .tlz, .order.  When FILE is -, qi can
read from the standard input.  See examples in *note Packages::.

3 The qirc file
***************

The global 'qirc' file offers a way to define variables and tools (such
as a download manager) for default use.  This file is used by qi at
runtime for e.g to build, install, remove or upgrade packages.

It has the following rules:

   * Variables must be declared as 'name=value'.

   * Declaration of values should only take one line, no line break.

   * For security reasons, assignments like 'name=$var' are only
     interpreted as literal.

The command line options related to the package directory and target
directory plus some of the options used for the build mode can override
some values in 'qirc'.  See *note Invoking qi::.

The order in which qi looks for this file is:

  1. '${HOME}/.qirc' Effective user.

  2. '${sysconfdir}/qirc' System-wide.

   If you intend to run qi as effective user, the file
'${sysconfdir}/qirc' could be copied to '${HOME}/.qirc' setting the
paths for '${packagedir}' and '${targetdir}' according to the '$HOME'.


File: qi.info,  Node: Packages,  Next: Recipes,  Prev: The qirc file,  Up: Top

4 Packages
**********

A package is a suite of programs usually distributed in binary form
which may also contain manual pages, documentation, or any other file
associated to a specific software.

   The package format used by qi is a simplified POSIX pax archive
compressed with lzip.  The file extension for packages ends in .tlz

Both package installation and package de-installation are managed using
two important (internal) variables: '${packagedir}' and '${targetdir}',
these values can be changed in the configuration file or via options.

   '${packagedir}' is a common directory tree where the package contents
will be decompressed (will reside).

   '${targetdir}' is a target directory where the links will be made by
graft(1) taking '${packagedir}/package_name' into account.

Packages are installed in self-contained directory trees and symbolic
links from a common area are made to the package files.  This allows
multiple versions of the same package to co-exist on the one system.

4.1 Package conflicts
=====================

All the links to install or remove a package are handled by graft(1).
Since multiple packages can be installed or removed at the same time,
certain conflicts may arise between the packages.

graft(1) defines a CONFLICT as one of the following conditions:

   * If the package object is a directory and the target object exists
     but is not a directory.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is not a symbolic link.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is a symbolic link to something other than the package
     object.

The default behavior of qi for an incoming package is to ABORT if a
conflict arises.  When a package is going to be deleted, qi tells to
graft(1) to remove those parts that are not in conflict, leaving the
links to the belonging package.  This behavior can be forced if the -p
option is given.

4.2 Installing packages
=======================

To install a single package, simply type:

     qi -i coreutils-8.30-i586+1.tlz

To install multiple packages at once, type:

     qi -i gcc-8.3.0-i586+1.tlz rafaela-2.2-i586+1.tlz ...

Warn about the files that will be linked:

     qi -w bash-5.0-i586+1.tlz

   This is to verify the content of a package before installing it.

See the process of an installation (very verbose):

     qi -i -v mariana-3.0-i586+1.tlz

   A second -v gives more.

Installing package in a different location:

     qi -r /media/floppy -i lzip-1.21-i586+1.tlz

   The -r option assumes '${targetdir}' and '${packagedir}'.  See:

     qi -r /home/selk -P /pkgs -t / -i lzip-1.21-i586+1.tlz

   In this case the content of "lzip-1.21-i586+1.tlz" will be
decompressed into '/home/selk/pkgs/lzip-1.21-i586+1'.  Assuming that the
main binary for lzip is under
'/home/selk/pkgs/lzip-1.21-i586+1/usr/bin/' the target for "usr/bin"
will be created at '/home/selk'.  Considering that you have exported the
'PATH' as '${HOME}/usr/bin', now the system is able to see the recent
lzip.

Installing from a list of packages using standard input:

     cat FILELIST.txt | qi -i -

   The list of packages must contain full path names to be passed in the
installation, e.g:
/var/cache/qi/packages/x86_64/devel/tcl-8.6.9-x86_64+1.tlz
/var/cache/qi/packages/x86_64/devel/tk-8.6.9.1-x86_64+1.tlz
/var/cache/qi/packages/x86_64/devel/vala-0.42.3-x86_64+1.tlz

4.3 Removing packages
=====================

To remove a package, simply type:

     qi -d xz-5.2.4-i586+1.tlz

Delete mode will match the package name using '${packagedir}' as prefix.
For example, if the value of '${packagedir}' is set to /usr/local/pkgs,
this will be equal to:

     qi -d /usr/local/pkgs/xz-5.2.4-i586+1

Detailed output (very verbose):

     qi -d -v /usr/local/pkgs/xz-5.2.4-i586+1

   A second -v gives more.

By default the delete mode does not preserve a package directory after
removing its links from '${targetdir}', but this behavior can be changed
if the -k option is passed:

     qi -d -k /usr/local/pkgs/lzip-1.21-i586+1

   This means that the links to the package can be reactivated, later:

     cd /usr/local/pkgs && graft -i lzip-1.21-i586+1

Removing package from a different location:

     qi -r /home/cthulhu -P /pkgs -t / -d xz-5.2.4-i586+1

Removing a package using standard input:

     echo "vala-0.42.3-x86_64+1" | qi -d -

   This will match with the package directory.

4.4 Upgrading packages
======================

The upgrade mode inherits the properties of the installation and removal
process.  To make sure that a package is updated, the package is
installed in a temporary directory taking '${packagedir}' into account.
Once the incoming package is pre-installed, qi can proceed to search and
delete packages that have the same name (considered as previous ones).
Finally, the package is re-installed at its final location and the
temporary directory is removed.

To upgrade a package, just type:

     qi -u gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

   This will proceed to update "gcc-9.0.1-i586+1" removing other
versions of "gcc" (if any).

If you want to keep the package directory of found versions during the
upgrade process, just pass:

     qi -u -k gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

To see the upgrade process (very verbose):

     qi -u -v gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

   A second -v gives more.

To force the upgrade of an existing package:

     qi -u -f gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

4.4.1 Package blacklist
-----------------------

To enforce general package facilities, either to install, remove or
maintain the hierarchy of packages in a clean manner, qi makes use of
the pruning operation via graft(1):

   There is a risk if those are crucial packages for the proper
functioning of the system, because it implies to deactivate symbolic
links from the target directory, _especially_ when transitioning an
incoming package into its final location during upgrade.

A blacklist for declare package names has been devised for this cases,
in case that a user decides to upgrade all packages in the system or,
just the crucial ones, such as the C library.

   The blacklist is related to the upgrade mode only, consists in
installing a package instead of updating it or removing previous
versions of it; the content of the package will be updated over the
existing content at '${packagedir}', while the existing links from
'${targetdir}' will be preserved.  A pruning of links will carried out
in order to re-link possible differences with the recent content, this
helps to avoid having dead links in the target directory.

Since the upgrade mode is also used to install a new package, the
mechanism for blacklist is to install a declared package if it does not
already exist, if it already exists, it is verified that the binary
package is newer than the package directory in order to perform an
update.

   Package names for the blacklist can be set from the configuration
file.

5 Recipes
*********

A recipe is a file telling qi what to do.  Most often, the recipe tells
to qi how to build a binary package from a source tarball.

   A recipe has two parts: a list of variable definitions and a list of
sections.  By convention, the syntax of a section is:

     section_name()
     {
         section lines
     }

   The section name is followed by parentheses, one newline and an
opening brace.  The line finishing the section contains just a closing
brace.  The section names or the function names currently recognized are
'build'.

   The 'build' section is an augmented shell script.  This is the main
section (or *shell function*) which contains the instructions to build
and produce a package.

5.1 Variables
=============

A "variable" is a *shell variable* defined either in 'qirc' or in a
recipe to represent a string of text, called the variable's "value".
These values are substituted by explicit request in the definitions of
other variables or in calls to external commands.

   Variables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to
compilers, programs to run, directories to look in for source files,
directories to write output in, or anything else you can imagine.

   Definitions of variables in qi have four levels of precedence.
Options which define variables from the command-line override those
specified in the 'qirc' file, while variables defined in the recipe
override those specified in 'qirc', taking priority over those variables
settled by options via command-line.  Finally, the variables have
default values if they are not defined anywhere.

   Options that set variables through the command-line can only
reference variables defined in 'qirc' and variables with default values.

   Definitions of variables in 'qirc' can only reference variables
previously defined in 'qirc' and variables with default values.

   Definitions of variables in the recipe can only reference variables
settled by command-line, variables previously defined in the recipe,
variables defined in 'qirc', and variables with default values.

5.2 Special variables
=====================

There are variables which can only be set using the command line options
or via 'qirc', there are other special variables which can be defined or
redefined in a recipe.  See the following definitions:

   'outdir' is the directory where the produced packages are written.
This variable can not be redefined in the recipe.  Default sets to
'/var/cache/qi/packages'.

   'worktree' is the working tree where archives, patches, and recipes
are expected.  This variable can not be redefined in the recipe.
Default sets to '/usr/src/qi'.

   'tardir' is defined in the recipe to the directory where the tarball
containing the source can be found.  The full name of the tarball is
composed as '${tardir}/$tarname'.  Its value is available in the recipe
as '${tardir}'; a value of .  for 'tardir' sets it to the value of CWD
(Current Working Directory), this is where the recipe lives.

   'arch' is the architecture to compose the package name.  Its value is
available in the recipe as '${arch}'.  Default value is the output of
'uname -m'.

   'jobs' is the number of parallel jobs to pass to the compiler.  Its
value is available in the recipe as '${jobs}'.  Default sets to '1'.

   The two variables '${srcdir}' and '${destdir}' can be set in the
recipe, as any other variable, but if they are not, qi uses default
values for them when building a package.

   'srcdir' contains the source code to be compiled, and defaults to
'${program}-${version}'.  'destdir' is the place where the built package
will be installed, and defaults to '${TMPDIR}/package-${program}'.

   If 'pkgname' is left undefined, the special variable 'program' is
assigned by default.  If 'pkgversion' is left undefined, the special
variable 'version' is assigned by default.

   'pkgname' and 'pkgversion' along with: 'version', 'arch', and
'release' are used to produce the name of the package in the form:
'${pkgname}-${pkgversion}-${arch}+${release}.tlz'

   A special variable called 'replace' can be used to declare package
names that will be replaced at the time of installation.

A typical recipe contains the following variables:

   * 'program': software name.

     It matches the source name.  It is also used to compose the name of
     the package if '${pkgname}' is not specified.

   * 'version': software version.

     It matches the source name.  It is also used to compose the version
     of the package if '${pkgversion}' is not specified.

   * 'arch': software architecture.

     It is used to compose the architecture of the package in which it
     is build.

   * 'release': release number.

     This is used to reflect the release number of the package.  It is
     recommended to increase this number after any significant change in
     the recipe or post-install script.

Obtaining sources over the network must be declared in the recipe using
the 'fetch' variable.  Use double quotes for separated values.

   The variables 'netget' and 'rsync' can be defined in 'qirc' to
establish a network downloader in order to get the sources.  If they are
not defined, qi uses default values:

   'netget' is the general network downloader tool, defaults sets to
'wget -c -w1 -t3 --no-check-certificate'.

   'rsync' is the network tool for sources containing the prefix for the
RSYNC protocol, default sets to 'rsync -v -a -L -z -i --progress'.

   The variable 'description' is used to print the package description
when a package is installed.

   A description has two parts: a brief description, and a long
description.  By convention, the syntax of 'description' is:

     description="
     Brief description.

     Long description.
     "

   The first (substantial) line of the value is a brief description of
the software (called "blurb").  A newline follows to separate the _brief
description_ from the _long description_.

An example looks like:

     description="
     The GNU core utilities.

     The GNU core utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
     utilities of the GNU operating system.  These are the core utilities
     which are expected to exist on every operating system.
     "

   Please consider a length limit of 78 characters as maximum, because
the same one would be used on the meta file creation.  See *note The
meta file: Recipes. section.

   The 'homepage' variable is used to declare the main site or home
page:

     homepage=http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc

   The variable 'license' is used for license information(1).  Some code
in the program can be covered by license A, license B, or license C. For
"separate licensing" or "heterogeneous licensing", we suggest using *|*
for a disjunction, *&* for a conjunction (if that ever happens in a
significant way), and comma for heterogeneous licensing.  Comma would
have lower precedence, plus added special terms.

     license="LGPL, GPL | Artistic + added permission"

5.3 Building packages
=====================

A recipe is any valid regular file, qi sets priorities to read a recipe,
for example, the Current Working Directory has priority over the working
tree (or where the recipes reside); the '${worktree}/recipes' is the
second place where to find a recipe, we complete the possibility of
using the directory name to invoke a recipe if it contains "recipe" as a
valid file name.

To build a single package, type:

     qi -b x-apps/xterm

Multiple jobs can be passed to the compiler for speed up the build
process:

     qi -b -j3 x-apps/xterm

Update or install the produced package (if it is not already installed)
when finish:

     qi -b -j3 -u x-apps/xterm

Only process a recipe but do not create the binary package:

     qi -b -n dict/aspell

   The options -i or -u have no effect when -n is given.

This can be useful to inspect the build process of recipe:

   qi -b -k -n dict/aspell 2>&1 | tee aspell-buildlog.txt

   The -k option could preserve the source directory and the destination
directory for later inspection.  A log file of the build process will be
created redirecting both, standard error and standard output to tee(1).

5.4 Variables from the environment
==================================

Qi has environment variables which can be used at build time:

   The variable 'TMPDIR' sets the temporary directory for sources, which
is used for package extractions (see *note Examining packages::) and to
prepend the value of '${srcdir}' and '${destdir}' on build mode.  By
convention its default value is equal to '/tmp'.

   The variables 'QICFLAGS', 'QICXXFLAGS', and 'QILDFLAGS' have no
effect by default.  The environment variables such as 'CFLAGS',
'CXXFLAGS', and 'LDFLAGS' are unset at compile time:

Recommended practices is to set variables in front of 'configure' or in
front of _make(1)_ instead of exporting to the environment.  As follows:

     Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
     environment passed to configure.  However, some packages may run
     configure again during the build, and the customized values of
     these variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you
     should set them in the configure command line, using 'VAR=value'.
     For example:

     './configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc'

     <http://gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Defining-Variables.html>

     Indeed, while configure can notice the definition of CC in
     './configure CC=bizarre-cc', it is impossible to notice it in
     'CC=bizarre-cc ./configure', which, unfortunately, is what most
     users do.

     [...]

     configure: error: changes in the environment can compromise the
     build.

     <http://gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Setting-Output-Variables.html>

     It is not wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on
     environment variables set up outside their control, since this
     would cause different users to get different results from the same
     makefile.  This is against the whole purpose of most makefiles.

     <http://gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Environment>

5.5 The meta file
=================

The "meta file" is a regular file created during the build mode, it
contains information about the package such as program name, program
version, release, fetch address, description, and other minor data
extracted from the processed recipe.  The name of the file is generated
as '${full_pkgname}.tlz.txt', it has the purpose to reflect essential
information to the user without having to look inside the package
content.

   The content of a meta file looks like:

     #
     # The Bourne Again SHell.
     #
     # Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from
     # the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).  It is intended to conform to
     # the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 shell and tools standard.
     #
     # It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and
     # interactive use.
     #

     QICFLAGS="-g0 -Os -mtune=generic -pipe"
     QICXXFLAGS="-g0 -Os -mtune=generic -pipe"
     QILDFLAGS="-s"
     program=bash
     version=5.0
     release=1
     blurb="The Bourne Again SHell."
     homepage="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash"
     license="GPLv3+"
     fetch="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-5.0.tar.gz"
     replace=""

   Package descriptions are extracted from the variable 'description',
each line is interpreted literally and pre-formatted to fit in (exactly)
*80 columns*; plus the character '#' is prefixed to every line.

In addition to the Special variables, there are implicit variables such
as 'blurb':

   The 'blurb' variable is related to the special variable
'description'.  Its value is composed using the first (substantial) line
of 'description', mentioned as the "brief description".

The order mode has the purpose to resolve the build order through .order
files.  An order file contains a list of recipe names, by default does
not perform any action other than to print a resolved list in descending
order.  For example, if *a* depends on *b* and *c*, and *c* depends on
*b* as well, the file might look like:

     a: c b
     b:
     c: b

   Each letter represents a recipe name, complete dependencies for the
first recipe name are listed in descending order, which is printed from
right to left, and removed from left to right:

   OUTPUT

     b
     c
     a

   Declaration of blank lines, colons, parentheses, and end of line are
ignored.  Comments are allowed for lines that begin with '#'.

An order file could be used to build a serie of packages, for example,
if the content is:

     # Image handling libraries
     libs/libjpeg-turbo: devel/nasm
     x-libs/jasper: libs/libjpeg-turbo
     libs/tiff: libs/libjpeg-turbo

   To proceed with each recipe, we can type:

     qi -o imglibs.order | qi -b -i -

   The output of 'qi -o imglibs.order' tells to qi in which order it
should build the recipes/packages:

     devel/nasm
     libs/libjpeg-turbo
     x-libs/jasper
     libs/tiff

7 Examining packages
********************

There is an option to make use of the "extraction mode" which serves to
examine binary packages for debugging purposes.  The extraction mode
consists of decompressing a package into a single directory, verifying
its integrity and preserving its properties.

     qi -x mksh-R56c-x86_64+1.tlz

   This action will put the content of "mksh-R56c-x86_64+1.tlz" into a
single directory, which is a private directory for the user who
requested the action, creation mode will be equal to *u=,g=rwx,o=rwx
(0700)*.  The package content will reside on this location, default mask
to deploy the content will be equal to *u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx (0000)*.

   The creation of the custom directory is influenced by the value of
the 'TMPDIR' variable.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
