1 Introduction
**************

Qi is a source builder and a package manager:

   It contains a set of (individual) tools to build, install, remove,
and upgrade software packages.  It follows the philosophy of simplicity
without adding too many features, such as those that can be found in
popular package managers.  Basically it does two things: builds
packages and manages them.

   Qi constructs the sources using recipe names, files that contain
specific instructions to build every source.  As result, a binary
package is obtained which can be installed, removed, upgraded, or
inspected in the system.

   The packages are managed thanks to an external tool called
_graft(1)_, which provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages
under a single directory hierarchy, it was inspired by both Depot
(Carnegie Mellon University) and Stow (Bob Glickstein).  In this
aspect, Qi complements Graft: it can work with packages, check them,
solve conflicts, and more...

2.1 Environment
===============

     Some influential environment variables:

`QICFLAGS'
     C compiler flags for building packages.

     Default value: _"-g0 -Os"_

`QICXXFLAGS'
     C++ compiler flags for building packages.

     Default value: _"-g0 -Os"_

`QILDFLAGS'
     Linker flags for building packages.

     Default value: _-s_

`DOPOST'
     post-install script control variable.

     The `DOPOST' variable is currently used for `pkgadd',
     `pkgupgrade', `pkgbuild' (when option -U is given).

     A different value than "DOPOST" omits the execution of the
     post-install script (if any).

`RC'
     Runtime configuration file.

     A different value than "RC" overrides the configuration file.

     This is used by: `pkgadd', `pkgremove', `pkgupgrade', `pkgbuild'.

`TMPDIR'
     Temporary directory (by default _/tmp_).

     `TMPDIR' is expanded with random numbers for major security.

     This is used by: `pkgbuild', `pkgerupt'.

2.2 Notes
=========

   * Command names has been prefixed with `pkg' to facilitate the set
     in relation to its purpose.

   * The _PREFIX_ reference is related with the installation prefix of
     Qi.

   * All the options can be mixed.  Options specified in the
     command-line have priority over the config file `qirc'.  If there
     are no options, and if `qirc' is not present, default (internal)
     values will be used instead.

3 The qirc file
***************

`qirc' is the configuration file for Qi used at runtime during the
installation, removal of a package or when a recipe is built.  This
file is optional, and it can be useful to define variables and
configure external tools (such as a download manager) for default use.

   * Variables are declared as `name=value'.

   * Declaration of values should only take one line, no line break.

   * Assignments like `name=$var' are only interpreted as literal.

The options specified in the command-line can override the values
specified in the configuration file.  For more information, see *note
Invocation::.

The order in which Qi looks for this file is:

  1. `${HOME}/.qirc'  Effective user.

  2. `${sysconfdir}/qirc'  System-wide.

   If you intend to run Qi for a specific user, you should copy the file
`${sysconfdir}/qirc' to `${HOME}/.qirc' setting `${packagedir}' and
`${targetdir}' for your `$HOME'.

4 Packages
**********

A package is a suite of programs usually distributed in binary form
which may also contain manual pages, documentation, or any other file
associated to a specific software.

   The Qi package format is a simple redistributable _tar(1)_ archive
compressed with _lzip(1)_.  The package extension ends in ".tlz".

Both package installation and package deinstallation are managed using
`${packagedir}' and `${targetdir}':

   `${packagedir}' is a common directory tree where the package contents
is decompressed (resides).  By default the tree is located at
_PREFIX/pkg_.

   `${targetdir}' is a target directory where the links will be made
taking `${packagedir}/package_name' into account.

   Packages are installed in self-contained directory trees and symbolic
links from a common area are made to the package files.  This allows
multiple versions of the same package to co-exist on the one system.

   All the links to install or to remove a package are managed using
_graft(1)_.  Since multiple packages can be installed or removed at the
same time, certain conflicts may arise between the packages.

   According to the User's Guide of Graft(1), a conflict is defined as
one of the following conditions:

   * If the package object is a directory and the target object exists
     but is not a directory.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is not a symbolic link.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is a symbolic link to something other than the package
     object.

Qi's default behavior is to not proceed with the installation when a
conflict occurs.  But when a package that is going to be removed is in
conflict with another package, _graft(1)_ removes those parts that are
not in conflict, leaving the links belonging to the original package.
This behavior can be changed if the option -p is specified (see the
examples below).

4.1 Adding packages
===================

This sort order is particularly useful just before the actual package
installation, because it helps to understand how the package
installation works:

  1. Detects and reports if the package is already installed.

  2. Ignores some signals up to completing the installation: HUP INT
     QUIT ABRT TERM.

  3. The integrity of the file (package) is checked.

  4. Creates required directory for the package as
     `${packagedir}/package_name'.

  5. Decompress the content of the package in
     `${packagedir}/package_name'.

  6. A test of the package is performed before completing the
     installation to see if there are no conflicts with another package.
     This is the default behavior if -p is not supplied.

  7. _graft(1)_ is invoked to install symbolic links from the package
     installation directory to the target directory.

  8. If the meta file is readable, the description will be shown for
     the package.

  9. Run post install instructions from `post-install', if any.

_Usage:_ pkgadd [-hfpVw] [-P <DIR>] [-t <DIR>] [package.tlz ...]

   To install a single package, simply type:

     pkgadd coreutils-8.24-x86_64+1.tlz

   To install multiple packages at once:

     pkgadd gcc-4.9.3-x86_64+1.tlz rafaela-2.2-i586+1.tlz ...

   Warn about the files that will be linked:

     pkgadd -w gcc-4.9.3-x86_64+1.tlz

   * This is to verify the content of a package before installing it.

   See what happens when a package is installed (very verbose):

     pkgadd -V mariana-3.0-x86_64+1.tlz

   * This is for a detailed (long) output.

   Installing in a different directory tree and target:

     pkgadd -P /tmp/pkgdir -T /tmp/targetdir lzip-1.17-i586+1.tlz

   When a package is already installed, `pkgadd' refuses to continue.
This is to keep some control over the database of your packages, if you
really want to force the installation of a package, you can use the -f
option (which implies -p).  See below.

   *Pruning conflicts*

   Remove objects (files, links or directories) from the target
directory that are in conflict with the package directory:

     pkgadd -p zutils-1.4-x86_64+1.tlz

   When the -p option is used, it proceeds to install the package
normally, but first will try to remove any conflict.  Use it with care,
combine this option with -V.

4.2 Removing packages
=====================

This sort order is particularly useful just before the actual package
deinstallation, because it helps to understand how the package
deinstallation works:

  1. Look for a package name to remove inside of `${packagedir}'.
     Package names must be specified using the full package name, such
     as "name-version-arch+release.tlz" or specifying the package name
     directory.

  2. Ignores some signals up to completing the deinstallation: HUP INT
     QUIT ABRT TERM.

  3. _graft(1)_ is invoked to remove symbolic links from the package
     installation directory to the target directory:

     If a conflict exists with another package, those links that are
     not in conflict will be preserved.  It's possible to prune all the
     conflicts using the -p option.

  4. Remove directories made empty by package deletion.  This has
     effect on `${targetdir}' but not for `${packagedir}'.

  5. The package directory is deleted if the option -k is not supplied.

_Usage:_ pkgremove [-hkpV] [-P <DIR>] [-t <DIR>] [package_name ...]

   To remove a package, just execute the command:

     pkgremove xz-5.2.2-x86_64+1

   To remove multiple versions of the same package:

     pkgremove xz*

   To remove multiple packages at once:

     pkgremove foo bar baz ...

   Detailed output (very verbose):

     pkgremove -V xz-5.2.2-x86_64+1

   Removing from a different directory tree and target:

     pkgremove -P /tmp/pkgdir -T /tmp/targetdir lzip-1.17-x86_64+1

   Pruning conflicts:

     pkgremove -p -V hunter

4.3 Upgrading packages
======================

This sort order is particularly useful just before the actual package
upgrade, because it helps to understand how the package upgrade works:

  1. Prepare temporary location for the incoming package.

  2. Pre-install incoming package into the temporary location.

  3. Remove packages under the same name: this is considered as the old
     packages. (Default behaviour if -k is not supplied).

  4. Upgrade or install the package calling to `pkgadd'.

  5. Delete temporary location of the package.

_Usage:_ pkgupgrade [-hkVw] [-P <DIR>] [-t <DIR>] [package.tlz ...]

   Upgrading a package is simple as:

     pkgupgrade coreutils-8.25-x86_64+1.tlz

`pkgupgrade' uses `pkgadd' and `pkgremove' to upgrade software
packages.  So it inherits the properties of each utility, except here,
only the essential options are provided.  For example, the option -V
(for a detailed output) belongs to when these utilities are invoked.
The options -P and -t work in the same way as the previous examples for
`pkgadd', `pkgremove'.  `pkgupgrade' will try to update the package or
to install it (in case it has not been installed).

   To see what packages will be updated (if any), always type:

     pkgupgrade -w coreutils-8.25-x86_64+1.tlz

4.4 Notes
=========

   * Some signals like HUP INT QUIT ABRT TERM are ignored on the
     package installation or deinstallation.  The intention is to ignore
     the cancellation while the package is being installed or removed
     (e.g.  Ctrl+C, terminal window closed, etc.).  The installation or
     removal of a package can be crucial for the proper functioning of
     the system.

   * The meta file is read from the directory where the package is
     found.

   * A post-install script is read from
     `${packagedir}/package_name/var/lib/qi/post-install/name.install'.

   * Default behavior is to upgrade or install a package removing old
     packages, this is "packages found under the same name".  If you
     want to preserve the multiple versions of the same package, you
     must pass the -k option.

5 Recipes
*********

A recipe is a file telling qi what to do.  Most often, the recipe tells
qi how to build a binary package from a source tarball.

   A recipe has two parts: a list of variable definitions and a list of
sections.  By convention, the syntax of a section is:

     section_name() {
       section lines
     }

   The section name is followed by parentheses, one space and an opening
brace.  The line finishing the section contains just a closing brace.
The section names or the function names currently recognized are
`build'.

   The `build' section is an augmented shell script.  This is the main
section (or *shell function*) which contains the instructions to build
and produce a package.

5.1 Variables
=============

A "variable" is a *shell variable* defined either in `qirc' or in a
recipe to represent a string of text, called the variable's "value".
These values are substituted by explicit request in the definitions of
other variables or in calls to external commands.

   Variables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to
compilers, programs to run, directories to look in for source files,
directories to write output in, or anything else you can imagine.

   Definitions of variables in qi have four levels of precedence.
Options which define variables from the command-line override those
specified in the `qirc' file, while variables defined in the recipe
override those specified in `qirc', taking priority over those
variables settled by options via command-line.  Finally, some variables
(arch, jobs, outdir, worktree, tardir, netget, rsync) have default
values if they are not defined anywhere.

   Options that set variables through the command-line can only
reference variables defined in `qirc' and variables with default values.

   Definitions of variables in `qirc' can only reference variables
previously defined in `qirc' and variables with default values.

   Definitions of variables in the recipe can only reference variables
settled by command-line, variables previously defined in the recipe,
variables defined in `qirc', and variables with default values.

5.1.1 Special variables
-----------------------

The three variables `arch', `jobs', and `outdir' can only be set using
command line options or in `qirc'.  If not specified, they have default
values.

   `arch' is the architecture to compose the package name.  Its value
is available in the recipe as `${arch}'.  Default value is the output
of `uname -m'.

   `jobs' is the number of jobs to pass to the compiler.  Its default
value is available in the recipe as `${jobs}'.  Defaults to `1'.

   `outdir' is the directory where the produced packages are written.
This variable cannot be redefined in the recipe.  Defaults to
`/var/cache/qi/packages'.

   `worktree' is the working tree where archives, patches, and recipes
are expected.  This variable cannot be redefined in the recipe.
Defaults to `/usr/src/qi'.

   The variable `tardir' is defined in the recipe to the directory
where the tarball containing the source can be found.  The full name of
the tarball is commonly used as `${tardir}/$tarname'.  A value of `.'
for `tardir' sets it to the value of the CWD (Current Working
Directory), this means, from where the recipe is located.

   The two variables `srcdir' and `destdir' can be defined in the
recipe, as any other variable, but if they are not, Qi uses default
values for them when building the package.

   `srcdir' contains the source code to be compiled, and defaults to
`${program}-${version}'.

   `destdir' is the place where the built package will be installed,
and defaults to `${TMPDIR}/package-${program}'.

   If `pkgname' is left undefined, the special variable `program' is
assigned by default.  If `pkgversion' is left undefined, the special
variable `version' is assigned by default.

   `pkgname', `pkgversion', along with `version', `arch', and
`release', are used to produce the name of the package in the form
`${pkgname}-${pkgversion}-${arch}+${release}.tlz'.  All of them must be
defined in the recipe, excepting `arch', which is optional.

   * `program': name of the package.

   * `version': version of the package.

   * `arch': architecture of the package.

   * `release': release number of the package. It is recommended to
     increase this number after any significant change in the recipe is
     made.

Obtaining sources over the network must be declared in the recipe using
the `fetch' variable.  Use double quotes for separated values.

   The variables `netget' and `rsync' can be defined in `qirc' to
establish a network downloader in order to get the sources.  If they
are not defined, qi uses default values:

   `netget' is the general network downloader tool for use, and
defaults to `wget -c -w1 -t3 --no-check-certificate'.

   `rsync' is the network tool for sources containing the prefix for
the RSYNC protocol, and defaults to `rsync -v -a -L -z -i --progress'.

There are three important variables to produce meta information of the
package: `description', `homepage', `license'.

   The variable `description' is special to write the description of the
package, which will be shown when installed.

   A description has two parts: a brief description and a long
description.  By convention, the syntax of a description is:

     description="
     Brief description.

     Long description.
     "

The first (substantial) line of the value is a brief description of the
software (called the "blurb").  A new (blank) line is followed to
separate the brief description from the long description.

   An example looks like:

     description="
     A source builder and a package manager.

     Qi is a source builder and a package manager.  It contains a set of
     tools to build, install, remove, and upgrade software packages.

     Qi follows the philosophy of the simplicity without adding too many
     features, such as those that can be found in popular package managers.
     Basically it does two things: builds packages and manages them.
     "

   * Consider a length limit of 78 characters as maximum.  *Note The
     meta file: Recipes.

The `homepage' variable is used simply to declare the main site or home
of the source, thus:

     homepage=http://www.dragora.org

The variable `license' is used for license information(1).  Some code
in the program can be covered by license A, license B, or license C.
For "separate licensing" or "heterogeneous licensing", we suggest using
*|* for a disjunction, *&* for a conjunction (if that ever happens in a
significant way), and comma for heterogeneous licensing.  Comma would
have lower precedence.  Plus added special terms.

     license="LGPL, GPL | Artistic, GPL + added permission"

5.1.2 Variables from the environment
------------------------------------

The variables `QICFLAGS', `QICXXFLAGS', and `QILDFLAGS' have no effect
by default.  The environment variables such as `CFLAGS', `CXXFLAGS',
and `LDFLAGS' are unset at compile time.

   Recommended practices is to set variables in front of `configure' or
in front of _make(1)_ instead of exporting to the environment.  As
follows:

     Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
     environment passed to configure. However, some packages may run
     configure again during the build, and the customized values of
     these variables may be lost. In order to avoid this problem, you
     should set them in the configure command line, using `VAR=value'.
     For example:

     `./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc'

     `http://gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Defining-Variables.html'

     Indeed, while configure can notice the definition of CC in
     `./configure CC=bizarre-cc', it is impossible to notice it in
     `CC=bizarre-cc ./configure', which, unfortunately, is what most
     users do.

     [...]

     configure: error: changes in the environment can compromise the
     build.

     `http://gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Setting-Output-Variables.html'

     It is not wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on
     environment variables set up outside their control, since this
     would cause different users to get different results from the same
     makefile.  This is against the whole purpose of most makefiles.

     `http://gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Environment'

5.2 The meta file
=================

The "meta file" is an external file created by `pkgbuild' when a recipe
is processed and when a package is produced.  The file is generated as
`${full_pkgname}.tlz.txt' which contains information about the package
such as `program', `version', `release'.  Also definitions of the
special variables `fetch', `description', `homepage', `license'.

   A meta file has the purpose to extract information and the purpose to
reflect essential information to the user without having to check
inside the package itself.

   The meta file is basically composed as:

     # Description

     variable=value
     ...

The description is extracted from the declared variable `description',
where each line is interpreted literally and where the description is
pre-formatted to fit in (exactly) 80 columns.  Plus `# ' is prepend to
each line.

   Followed by new line, the rest is composed by variables; the
inclusion of its values, may vary.  For example, in addition to the
special variables, there are implicit variables such as `blurb',
`depends'.

   The `blurb' variable is related to the special variable
`description'.  Always taking the first (substantial) line or "brief
description".

   The value of `depends' only will be included if the `depends' file
is a regular file.  *Note The depends file: Order files.

Now let's take a look on a real example of a meta file:

     # A lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm.
     #
     # Clzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to
     # the one of gzip or bzip2.  Clzip is about as fast as gzip, compresses

     # recovery perspective.
     #
     # Clzip uses the lzip file format; the files produced by clzip are fully
     # compatible with lzip-1.4 or newer, and can be rescued with lziprecover.

   Creation of the meta file is made in `${outdir}'.

5.3 Building packages
=====================

This sort order is particularly useful just before the actual package
build, because it helps to understand how a package is being built:

  1. A recipe is read from the current directory, if not, it will be
     looked in `${worktree}/recipes'.  Names of recipes can be invoked
     relative to `${worktree}/recipes'.  The recipe must be a regular
     file and must be readable by the user who is running the command.

  2. Checks are made when the recipe is imported (included), essential
     variable names cannot be empty: `program', `version', `release'.
     Also the main function `build()' must be present.

  3. `pkgbuild' tries to obtain the sources remotely if it does not
     exist locally (`${tardir}').  Once the source is already in place,
     its timestamp is updated, creating or updating the SHA1 sum.

  4. Required directories are created: `${TMPDIR}/$srcdir',
     `${outdir}', `${destdir}/var/lib/qi/recipes'.

  5. Sane ownerships and permissions are applied to the full source
     directory: `${TMPDIR}/$srcdir'.

  6. The main function `build()' is called.  Exits immediately if a
     command exits with a non-zero status.

  7. A package is going to be created under the following conditions:

        * If `${destdir}' is not empty.

        * If the option -n was not given.

     A copy of the recipe (file) is included on
     `${destdir}/var/lib/qi/recipes' as `${full_pkgname}.recipe'.

     If the `post-install' script is in the current working directory
     or from where the recipe name resides, it will be added as
     `${destdir}/var/lib/qi/post-install/${full_pkgname}.install'.

     The package is produced from the content of `${destdir}'.  First,
     creating a tarball, and then compressing it using the maximum
     level of compression of _lzip(1)_.

  8. By default, directories like `${TMPDIR}/$srcdir' and `${destdir}'
     are deleted.

  9. If the option -U is given, `pkgupgrade' is invoked to install or
     upgrade the package.


_Usage:_ pkgbuild [-hiknU] [-a <ARCH>] [-j <JOBS>] [-o <DIR>] [recipe
...]

   To build a single package, simply type:

     pkgbuild clzip.recipe

   Compile passing parallel jobs to the compiler for speed up the
process:

     pkgbuild -j4 clzip.recipe

   To build and install or upgrade multiple packages at once:

     pkgbuild -U clzip.recipe zutils.recipe matias.recipe

   Reading recipes and building from the output of a command:

     cat depends | pkgbuild -

   Incrementing the release number after a significant change in a
recipe:
     pkgbuild -i stargazer.recipe

If the recipe name cannot be read from the current directory or from a
specific path name, `${worktree}/recipes' is used for the search:

   There is a special case for the names of recipes `recipe'.
`pkgbuild' can complete the recipe name without being required to be
specified in the command-line, only if the name of the recipe is
`recipe'.  For example:

     pkgbuild devel/gcc

   Will complete the search as `${worktree}/recipes/devel/gcc/recipe'.

5.4 Writing recipes
===================

5.4.1 Internal functions
------------------------

Some internal functions are available to be applied on the recipe:

`unpack()'
     The unpack function can decompress multiple (compressed) files
     while verifies the integrity.  Depending on where the function is
     called, the decompression occurs in the current working directory.

     Usage: `unpack file(s) ...'

     The cases supported for the special extensions are: *.tar, *.tar.*,
     *.tgz*, *.tbz*, *.tlz*, *.txz*, *.zip, *.ZIP, *.gz, *.bz2, *.lz.

6 Order files
*************

`pkgorder' has the purpose to resolve the build order through .order
files.  In other words, is a good complement for `pkgbuild'.

_Usage:_ pkgorder [-x] [file_name.order ...]

Basically, `pkgorder' reads from a declared file which ends in
".order".  The output is an ordered list of recipe names which can be
passed to `pkgbuild' (via a pipe) to build a number or a series of
packages.

   DECLARATION

   If 'a' depends on 'b' and 'c', and 'c' depends on 'b' as well, the
file might look like:

     a.recipe: c.recipe b.recipe
     b.recipe:
     c.recipe: b.recipe

   Each letter represents a recipe name, complete dependencies for the
first recipe name are listed in descending order, which is printed from
right to left, and removed from left to right:

   OUTPUT

     b.recipe
     c.recipe
     a.recipe

   * Commented lines starting with a '#' are allowed.  Blank lines,
     colons, parentheses, and end of line are removed.

6.1 The depends file
====================

When `pkgorder' read from an order file; by default, it will proceed to
read the dependencies of each recipe.  This behavior can be omitted if
the -x option is given.

   The procedure for reading the dependencies of each recipe is
extracting the directory location where the order file resides.  Then
it iterates over the declared items extracting its location in search
of the special file `depends'.

   * The `depends' file only is read (sequentially) if it is a regular
     file and is not empty.

The special file `depends' must contain a list of prerequisites for the
recipe.  Prerequisites are names of valid recipes, including its
location.  The location must be relative to `${worktree}' (variable
described in *note Recipes::).

   Example of a `depends' file declared for _bash.recipe_:

     libs/readline/readline.recipe

   Then, if _core/bash/bash.recipe_ has been declared on _core.order_,
the output would be:

     ...
     libs/readline/readline.recipe
     core/bash/bash.recipe
     ...

   Combined in a pipe, _readline_ represents the first dependency of
_bash_:

     `pkgorder core.order | pkgbuild -U -'

7 Examine packages
******************

`pkgerupt' is a special command to examine packages for debugging
purposes.

_Usage:_ pkgerupt [-h] [package.tlz ...]

   When a package name is given `pkgerupt' will create a random
directory for the package.  The prefix directory where the random
directory is created is controlled by the `TMPDIR' variable, by default
`TMPDIR' is assigned to _/tmp_.  Creation mode is "u=,g=rwx,o=rwx"
(0700).

   The extraction to inspecting a package is equivalent to the shell
instruction:

     `( umask 000 && cd -- $PRVDIR && lzip -cd - | tar -xf - ) < $file'

   The package content is decompressed in the random (private) directory
via pipe.  Creation mode is "u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx" (0777).

   If there is any substantial change, consider increasing the build
number when repackaging: edit the value of the `release' variable
(recipe), compose the output file using the new number.

Some symbols are used for output messages to help to identify the
messages shown by the tools in Qi.  There are four simple categories
where the symbols are represented:


*Specifics*

   This symbols are unique to identify the running tool:

`+'
     This symbol belongs to the `pkgadd' tool.

`-'
     This symbol belongs to the `pkgremove' tool.

`~'
     This symbol belongs to the `pkgupgrade' tool.

`#'
     This symbol belongs to the `pkgbuild' tool.

`='
     This symbol belongs to the `pkgerupt' tool.

`%'
     This symbol is used to scan a package or to warn when the option
     is used.

     Specific symbols are enclosed between `( )'.

     *Preventive*

     Preventive symbols are intended to alert the user about unforeseen
     or important situations, and to meet requirements before
     proceeding:

`*'
     Normally used for testing compressed sources, obtain remote
     sources, or set system permissions.

     Preventive symbols are enclosed between `[ ]'.

     *Informative*

     Informative symbols are intended to inform users the most essential
     tasks during the execution:

`i'
     Symbol used when a task is going to be performed or when a task has
     been completed.

`!'
     This symbol informs about deleting files.

     Informative symbols are enclosed between `[ ]'.

   *Transitory*

   Transitory symbols are part for occasional changes (`@') but no less
important.  Also to invoke Qi tools externally (`^').

   Transitory symbols are enclosed between `{ }'.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
