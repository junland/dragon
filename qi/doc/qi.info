1 Introduction
**************

Qi is a simple but well-integrated package manager.  It can create,
install, remove, and upgrade software packages.  Qi produces binary
packages using recipes, which are files containing specific instructions
to build each package from source.  Qi can manage multiple packages
under a single directory hierarchy.  This method allows to maintain a
set of packages and multiple versions of them.  This means that Qi could
be used as the main package manager or complement the existing one.

   Qi offers a friendly command line interface, a global configuration
file, a simple recipe layout to deploy software packages; also works
with binary packages in parallel, speeding up installations and packages
in production.  The format used for packages is a simplified but safe
POSIX pax archive compressed with lzip.

   Qi is a modern (POSIX-compliant) shell script released under the
terms of the GNU General Public License.  There are only two major
dependencies for the magic: graft(1) and tarlz(1), the rest is expected
to be found in any Unix-like system.

2 Invoking qi
*************

This chapter describes the synopsis and command line options for invoke
Qi.

     Usage: qi [OPTION]... [FILE]...

One mandatory option specifies the operation that 'qi' should perform,
other options are meant to detail how this operation should be
performed.

qi supports the following options to operate:

'-b'
     Build package using recipe names.

'-c'
     Create .tlz package from directory.

'-d'
     Delete packages.

'-i'
     Install packages.

'-o'
     Resolve build order through .order files.

'-u'
     Upgrade packages (implies -i, -d and -p options).

'-w'
     Warn about files that will be linked.

'-x'
     Extract a package for debugging purposes.

There are common options between modes:

'-N'
     Do not read the configuration file.

     This will ignore any value in the qirc file.

'-P <DIR>'
     Package directory for installations.

     This option sets '${packagedir}'.

     Only valid for -i, -d, or -u options.

'-f'
     Force option.

     This option can force the build of a recipe, or force the upgrade
     of a pre-existing package.

     Only valid for -b, -u options.

'-t <DIR>'
     Target directory for symbolic links.

     This option sets '${targetdir}'.

     Only valid for -i, -d, or -u options.

'-k'
     Keep (don't delete) '${srcdir}' or '${destdir}' in build mode, keep
     (don't delete) package directory in delete mode.

     Only valid for -b, -d or -u options.

'-p'
     Prune conflicts on package installations.

     This option may proceed with the package installation if one or
     more conflicts occur.

'-r /rootdir'
     Use the fully qualified named directory as the root directory for
     all qi operations.  The target directory and package directory will
     be relative to the specified directory, including the log file for
     graft.

'-v'
     Be verbose (a 2nd -v gives more).

Options for build mode (-b):

'-O <DIR>'
     Where the packages produced are written.

     This option sets '${outdir}'.

'-W <DIR>'
     Where archives, patches, and recipes are expected.

     This option sets '${worktree}'.

'-Z <DIR>'
     Where (compressed) sources will be found.

     This option sets '${tardir}'.

'-a'
     Architecture to use.

     Default value is obtained via uname(1) as 'uname -m'.

'-j'
     Parallel jobs for the compiler.

     If not specified, default sets to 1.

'-1'
     Increment release number ('${release}' + 1).

     It will be omitted if the -n option is being used.

'-n'
     Don't create a .tlz package.

'-S'
     Selects the option to skip completed recipes.

     This means, in interactive mode, when the dialog to summarize
     recipes is shown.

Informative options:

'-L'
     Print default directory locations.

     This will print the target directory, package directory, working
     tree, the directory for tarballs, and the output directory for the
     packages produced.

'-h'
     Display the help describing the options and then exit.

'-V'
     Print the version number and license information.  The version
     number should be included in all bug reports.

Expected non-option arguments are package directories and regular files:
recipes or files ending in .tlz, .order.

   When FILE is -, qi can read from the standard input.  See examples at
*note Packages::.

3 The qirc file
***************

The global 'qirc' file offers a way to define variables and tools (such
as a download manager) for default use.  This file is used by qi at
runtime, e.g., to build, install, remove or upgrade packages.

   Variables and their possible values must be declared as any other
variable in the shell.

The command line options related to the package directory and target
directory and some of the command line options used for the build mode,
have the power to override the values declared on 'qirc'.  See *note
Invoking qi::.

The order in which qi looks for this file is:

  1. '${HOME}/.qirc' Effective user.

  2. '${sysconfdir}/qirc' System-wide.

   If you intend to run qi as effective user, the file
'${sysconfdir}/qirc' could be copied to '${HOME}/.qirc' setting the
paths for '${packagedir}' and '${targetdir}' according to the '$HOME'.


File: qi.info,  Node: Packages,  Next: Recipes,  Prev: The qirc file,  Up: Top

4 Packages
**********

A package is a suite of programs usually distributed in binary form
which may also contain manual pages, documentation, or any other file
associated to a specific software.

   The package format used by qi is a simplified POSIX pax archive
compressed with lzip(1).  The file extension for packages ends in
'.tlz'.

Both package installation and package de-installation are managed using
two important (internal) variables: '${packagedir}' and '${targetdir}',
these values can be changed in the configuration file or via options.

   '${packagedir}' is a common directory tree where the package contents
will be decompressed (will reside).

   '${targetdir}' is a target directory where the links will be made by
graft(1) taking '${packagedir}/package_name' into account.

Packages are installed in self-contained directory trees and symbolic
links from a common area are made to the package files.  This allows
multiple versions of the same package to coexist on the same system.

4.1 Package conflicts
=====================

All the links to install or remove a package are handled by graft(1).
Since multiple packages can be installed or removed at the same time,
certain conflicts may arise between the packages.

graft(2) defines a CONFLICT as one of the following conditions:

   * If the package object is a directory and the target object exists
     but is not a directory.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is not a symbolic link.

   * If the package object is not a directory and the target object
     exists and is a symbolic link to something other than the package
     object.

The default behavior of qi for an incoming package is to ABORT if a
conflict arises.  When a package is going to be deleted, qi tells to
graft(1) to remove those parts that are not in conflict, leaving the
links to the belonging package.  This behavior can be forced if the -p
option is given.

4.2 Installing packages
=======================

To install a single package, simply type:

     qi -i coreutils-8.30-i586+1.tlz

To install multiple packages at once, type:

     qi -i gcc-8.3.0-i586+1.tlz rafaela-2.2-i586+1.tlz ...

Warn about the files that will be linked:

     qi -w bash-5.0-i586+1.tlz

   This is to verify the content of a package before installing it.

See the process of an installation (very verbose):

     qi -i -v mariana-3.0-i586+1.tlz

   A second -v gives more.

Installing package in a different location:

     qi -r /media/floppy -i lzip-1.21-i586+1.tlz

   Important: the -r option assumes '${targetdir}' and '${packagedir}'.
See the following example.

     qi -r /home/selk -i lzip-1.21-i586+1.tlz

   In this case the content of "lzip-1.21-i586+1.tlz" will be
decompressed into '/home/selk/pkgs/lzip-1.21-i586+1'.  Assuming that the
main binary for lzip is under
'/home/selk/pkgs/lzip-1.21-i586+1/usr/bin/' the target for "usr/bin"
will be created at '/home/selk'.  Considering that you have exported the
'PATH' as '${HOME}/usr/bin', now the system is able to see the recent
lzip.

Installing from a list of packages using standard input:

     qi -i - < PACKAGELIST.txt

   Or in combination with another tool:
     sort -u PACKAGELIST.txt | qi -i -

   The list of packages must contain full path names to be passed in the
installation, e.g.:
     /var/cache/qi/packages/tcl-8.6.9-x86_64+1.tlz
     /var/cache/qi/packages/tk-8.6.9.1-x86_64+1.tlz
     /var/cache/qi/packages/vala-0.42.3-x86_64+1.tlz

4.3 Removing packages
=====================

To remove a package, simply type:

     qi -d xz-5.2.4-i586+1.tlz

Delete mode will match the package name using '${packagedir}' as prefix.
For example, if the value of '${packagedir}' is set to /usr/pkg, this
will be equal to:

     qi -d /usr/pkg/xz-5.2.4-i586+1

Detailed output (very verbose):

     qi -d -v /usr/pkg/xz-5.2.4-i586+1

   A second -v gives more.

By default the delete mode does not preserve a package directory after
removing its links from '${targetdir}', but this behavior can be changed
if the -k option is passed:

     qi -d -k /usr/pkg/lzip-1.21-i586+1

   This means that the links to the package can be reactivated, later:

     cd /usr/pkg && graft -i lzip-1.21-i586+1

Removing package from a different location:

     qi -r /home/cthulhu -d xz-5.2.4-i586+1

Removing a package using standard input:

     echo "vala-0.42.3-x86_64+1" | qi -d -

   This will match with the package directory.

4.4 Upgrading packages
======================

The upgrade mode inherits the properties of the installation and removal
process.  To make sure that a package is updated, the package is
installed in a temporary directory taking '${packagedir}' into account.
Once the incoming package is pre-installed, qi can proceed to search and
delete packages that have the same name (considered as previous ones).
Finally, the package is re-installed at its final location and the
temporary directory is removed.

To upgrade a package, just type:

     qi -u gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

   This will proceed to upgrade "gcc-9.0.1-i586+1" removing any other
version of "gcc" (if any).

If you want to keep the package directories of versions found during the
upgrade process, just pass:

     qi -u -k gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

To see the upgrade process (very verbose):

     qi -u -v gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

   A second -v gives more.

To force the upgrade of an existing package:

     qi -u -f gcc-9.0.1-i586+1.tlz

4.4.1 Package blacklist
-----------------------

To implement general package facilities, either to install, remove or
maintain the hierarchy of packages in a clean manner, qi makes use of
the pruning operation via graft(1) by default:

   There is a risk if those are crucial packages for the proper
functioning of the system, because it implies the deactivation of
symbolic from the target directory, _especially_ when transitioning an
incoming package into its final location during upgrade.

A blacklist of package names has been devised for the case where a user
decides to upgrade all packages in the system, or just the crucial ones,
such as the C library.

   The blacklist is related to the upgrade mode only, consists in
installing a package instead of updating it or removing previous
versions of it; the content of the package will be updated over the
existing content at '${packagedir}', while the existing links from
'${targetdir}' will be preserved.  A pruning of links will be carried
out in order to re-link possible differences with the recent content,
this helps to avoid leaving dead links in the target directory.

The package names for the blacklist to be declared must be set from the
configuration file.

5 Recipes
*********

A recipe is a file telling qi what to do.  Most often, the recipe tells
qi how to build a binary package from a source tarball.

   A recipe has two parts: a list of variable definitions and a list of
sections.  By convention, the syntax of a section is:

     section_name()
     {
         section lines
     }

   The section name is followed by parentheses, one newline and an
opening brace.  The line finishing the section contains just a closing
brace.  The section names or the function names currently recognized are
'build'.

   The 'build' section is an augmented shell script.  This is the main
section (or *shell function*) which contains the instructions to build
and produce a package.

5.1 Variables
=============

A "variable" is a *shell variable* defined either in 'qirc' or in a
recipe to represent a string of text, called the variable's "value".
These values are substituted by explicit request in the definitions of
other variables or in calls to external commands.

   Variables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to
compilers, programs to run, directories to look in for source files,
directories to write output to, or anything else you can imagine.

   Definitions of variables in qi have four levels of precedence.
Options which define variables from the command-line override those
specified in the 'qirc' file, while variables defined in the recipe
override those specified in 'qirc', taking priority over those variables
set by command-line options.  Finally, the variables have default values
if they are not defined anywhere.

   Options that set variables through the command-line can only
reference variables defined in 'qirc' and variables with default values.

   Definitions of variables in 'qirc' can only reference variables
previously defined in 'qirc' and variables with default values.

   Definitions of variables in the recipe can only reference variables
set by the command-line, variables previously defined in the recipe,
variables defined in 'qirc', and variables with default values.

5.2 Special variables
=====================

There are variables which can only be set using the command line options
or via 'qirc', there are other special variables which can be defined or
redefined in a recipe.  See the following definitions:

   'outdir' is the directory where the packages produced are written.
This variable can be redefined per-recipe.  Default sets to
'/var/cache/qi/packages'.

   'worktree' is the working tree where archives, patches, and recipes
are expected.  This variable can not be redefined in the recipe.
Default sets to '/usr/src/qi'.

   'tardir' is defined in the recipe to the directory where the tarball
containing the source can be found.  The full name of the tarball is
composed as '${tardir}/$tarname'.  Its value is available in the recipe
as '${tardir}'; a value of .  for 'tardir' sets it to the value of CWD
(Current Working Directory), this is where the recipe lives.

   'arch' is the architecture to compose the package name.  Its value is
available in the recipe as '${arch}'.  Default value is the output of
'uname -m'.

   'jobs' is the number of parallel jobs to pass to the compiler.  Its
value is available in the recipe as '${jobs}'.  The default value is 1.

   The two variables '${srcdir}' and '${destdir}' can be set in the
recipe, as any other variable, but if they are not, qi uses default
values for them when building a package.

   'srcdir' contains the source code to be compiled, and defaults to
'${program}-${version}'.  'destdir' is the place where the built package
will be installed, and defaults to '${TMPDIR}/package-${program}'.

   If 'pkgname' is left undefined, the special variable 'program' is
assigned by default.  If 'pkgversion' is left undefined, the special
variable 'version' is assigned by default.

   'pkgname' and 'pkgversion' along with: 'version', 'arch', 'release',
and (optionally) 'pkgcategory' are used to produce the package name in
the form:
'${pkgname}-${pkgversion}-${arch}+${release}[@${pkgcategory}].tlz'

   'pkgcategory' is an optional special variable that can be defined on
the recipe to categorize the package name.  If it is defined, then the
package output will be composed as
'${pkgname}-${pkgversion}-${arch}+${release}@${pkgcategory}.tlz'.
Automatically, the value of 'pkgcategory' will be prefixed using the '@'
character.

   A special variable called 'replace' can be used to declare package
names that will be replaced at installation time.

A typical recipe contains the following variables:

   * 'program': Software name.

     It matches the source name.  It is also used to compose the name of
     the package if '${pkgname}' is not specified.

   * 'version': Software version.

     It matches the source name.  It is also used to compose the version
     of the package if '${pkgversion}' is not specified.

   * 'arch': Software architecture.

     It is used to compose the architecture of the package in which it
     is build.

   * 'release': Release number.

     This is used to reflect the release number of the package.  It is
     recommended to increase this number after any significant change in
     the recipe or post-install script.

   * 'pkgcategory': Package category.

     Optional but recommended variable to categorize the package name
     when it is created.

Obtaining sources over the network must be declared in the recipe using
the 'fetch' variable.

   The variables 'netget' and 'rsync' can be defined in 'qirc' to
establish a network downloader in order to get the sources.  If they are
not defined, qi uses default values:

   'netget' is the general network downloader tool, defaults sets to
'wget -c -w1 -t3 --no-check-certificate'.

   'rsync' is the network tool for sources containing the prefix for the
RSYNC protocol, default sets to 'rsync -v -a -L -z -i --progress'.

   The variable 'description' is used to print the package description
when a package is installed.

   A description has two parts: a brief description, and a long
description.  By convention, the syntax of 'description' is:

     description="
     Brief description.

     Long description.
     "

   The first line of the value represented is a brief description of the
software (called "blurb").  A blank line separates the _brief
description_ from the _long description_, which should contain a more
descriptive description of the software.

An example looks like:

     description="
     The GNU core utilities.

     The GNU core utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
     utilities of the GNU operating system.  These are the core utilities
     which are expected to exist on every operating system.
     "

   Please consider a length limit of 78 characters as maximum, because
the same one would be used on the meta file creation.  See *note The
meta file: Recipes. section.

   The 'homepage' variable is used to declare the main site or home
page:

     homepage=http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc

   The variable 'license' is used for license information(1).  Some code
in the program can be covered by license A, license B, or license C. For
"separate licensing" or "heterogeneous licensing", we suggest using *|*
for a disjunction, *&* for a conjunction (if that ever happens in a
significant way), and comma for heterogeneous licensing.  Comma would
have lower precedence, plus added special terms.

     license="LGPL, GPL | Artistic + added permission"

5.3 Writing recipes
===================

Originally, Qi was designed for the version 3 of Dragora GNU/Linux; this
doesn't mean you can't use it in another distribution, just that if you
do, you'll have to try it out for yourself.  To help with this, here are
some references to well-written recipes:

   * <http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/dragora.git/tree/recipes>
   * <http://notabug.org/dragora/dragora/src/master/recipes>

5.4 Building packages
=====================

A recipe is any valid regular file.  Qi sets priorities for reading a
recipe, the order in which qi looks for a recipe is:

  1. Current working directory.

  2. If the specified path name does not contain "recipe" as the last
     component.  Qi will complete it by adding "recipe" to the path
     name.

  3. If the recipe is not in the current working directory, it will be
     searched under '${worktree}/recipes'.  The last component will be
     completed adding "recipe" to the specified path name.

To build a single package, type:

     qi -b x-apps/xterm

Multiple jobs can be passed to the compiler to speed up the build
process:

     qi -b -j3 x-apps/xterm

Update or install the package produced (if it is not already installed)
when finish:

     qi -b -j3 -u x-apps/xterm

Only process a recipe but do not create the binary package:

     qi -b -n dict/aspell

   The options -i or -u have no effect when -n is given.

This can be useful to inspect the build process of recipe:

   qi -b -k -n dict/aspell 2>&1 | tee aspell-buildlog.txt

   The -k option could preserve the source directory and the destination
directory for later inspection.  A log file of the build process will be
created redirecting both, standard error and standard output to tee(1).

5.5 Variables from the environment
==================================

Qi has environment variables which can be used at build time:

   The variable 'TMPDIR' sets the temporary directory for sources, which
is used for package extractions (see *note Examining packages::) and is
prepended to the value of '${srcdir}' and '${destdir}' in build mode.
By convention its default value is equal to '/usr/src/qi/build'.

   The variables 'QICFLAGS', 'QICXXFLAGS', and 'QILDFLAGS' have no
effect by default.  The environment variables such as 'CFLAGS',
'CXXFLAGS', and 'LDFLAGS' are unset at compile time:

Recommended practice is to set variables in the command line of
'configure' or _make(1)_ instead of exporting to the environment.  As
follows:

   <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Environment.html>
     It is not wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on
     environment variables set up outside their control, since this
     would cause different users to get different results from the same
     makefile.  This is against the whole purpose of most makefiles.

   Setting environment variables for configure is deprecated because
running configure in varying environments can be dangerous.

   <http://gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Defining-Variables.html>
     Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
     environment passed to configure.  However, some packages may run
     configure again during the build, and the customized values of
     these variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you
     should set them in the configure command line, using 'VAR=value'.
     For example:

     './configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc'

   <http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Setting-Output-Variables.html>
     If for instance the user runs 'CC=bizarre-cc ./configure', then the
     cache, config.h, and many other output files depend upon bizarre-cc
     being the C compiler.  If for some reason the user runs ./configure
     again, or if it is run via './config.status --recheck', (See
     Automatic Remaking, and see config.status Invocation), then the
     configuration can be inconsistent, composed of results depending
     upon two different compilers.  [...]  Indeed, while configure can
     notice the definition of CC in './configure CC=bizarre-cc', it is
     impossible to notice it in 'CC=bizarre-cc ./configure', which,
     unfortunately, is what most users do.  [...]  configure: error:
     changes in the environment can compromise the build.

5.6 The meta file
=================

The "meta file" is a regular file created during the build mode, it
contains information about the package such as package name, package
version, architecture, release, fetch address, description, and other
minor data extracted from processed recipes.  The name of the file is
generated as '${full_pkgname}.tlz.txt', and its purpose is to reflect
essential information to the user without having to look inside the
package content.  The file format is also intended to be used by other
scripts or by common Unix tools.

   The content of a meta file looks like:

     #
     # Pattern scanning and processing language.
     #

   Package descriptions are extracted from the variable 'description'
where each line is interpreted literally and pre-formatted to fit in
(exactly) *80 columns*, plus the character '#' and a blank space is
prefixed to every line (shell comments).

In addition to the Special variables, there are implicit variables such
as 'blurb':

   The 'blurb' variable is related to the special variable
'description'.  Its value is made from the first (substantial) line of
'description', mentioned as the "brief description".

6 Order files
*************

The order mode has the purpose of resolving the build order through
.order files.  An order file contains a list of recipe names, by default
does not perform any action other than to print a resolved list in
descending order.  For example, if *a* depends on *b* and *c*, and *c*
depends on *b* as well, the file might look like:

     a: c b
     b:
     c: b

   Each letter represents a recipe name, complete dependencies for the
first recipe name are listed in descending order, which is printed from
right to left, and removed from left to right:

   OUTPUT

     b
     c
     a

   Blank lines, colons and parentheses are simply ignored.  Comment
lines beginning with '#' are allowed.

An order file could be used to build a series of packages, for example,
if the content is:

     # Image handling libraries

     libs/libjpeg-turbo: devel/nasm
     x-libs/jasper: libs/libjpeg-turbo
     libs/tiff: libs/libjpeg-turbo

   To proceed with each recipe, we can type:

     qi -o imglibs.order | qi -b -i -

   The output of 'qi -o imglibs.order' tells to qi in which order it
should build the recipes:

     devel/nasm
     libs/libjpeg-turbo
     x-libs/jasper
     libs/tiff

7 Creating packages
*******************

The "creation mode" is an internal function of qi to make new Qi
compatible compatible packages, the creation mode is selected by the -c
option.  A package is produced using the contents of the Current
Directory, and the package file is written out.

     Usage: qi -c [OUTPUT/PACKAGENAME.TLZ]...

   The argument for the file name to be written must contain a fully
qualified named directory as the output directory where the package
produced will be written.  The file name should be composed using the
full name: name-version-architecture+release.tlz

   EXAMPLE

     cd /usr/pkg
     cd claws-mail-3.17.1-x86_64+1
     qi -c /var/cache/qi/packages/claws-mail-3.17.1-x86_64+1.tlz

   In this case, the package "claws-mail-3.17.1-x86_64+1.tlz" will be
written into '/var/cache/qi/packages/'.

All packages produced are complemented by a checksum file (.sha256).

8 Examining packages
********************

The "extraction mode" serves to examine binary packages for debugging
purposes.  The extraction mode is selected by the -x option.  It
decompresses a package into a single directory, verifying its integrity
and preserving its properties.

     Usage: qi -x [PACKAGENAME.TLZ]...

   EXAMPLE

     qi -x mksh-R56c-x86_64+1.tlz

   This action will put the content of "mksh-R56c-x86_64+1.tlz" into a
single directory, this will be a private directory for the user who

   requested the action, creation mode will be equal to *u=rwx,g=,o=
(0700)*.  The package content will reside on this location, default mask
to deploy the content will be equal to *u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx (0000)*.

The creation of the custom directory is influenced by the value of the
'TMPDIR' variable.

9 Exit status
*************

All the exit codes are described in this chapter.

'0'
     Successful completion (no errors).

'1'
     Minor common errors:

        * Help usage on illegal options or required arguments.

        * Program needed by qi (prerequisite) is not available.

'2'
     Command execution error:

     This code is used to return the evaluation of external commands and
     shell arguments in case of error.

'3'
     Integrity check error for compressed files.

     Compressed files means:

        * Tarball files from tar(1).  Supported extensions: .tar,
          .tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.Z, .tar.bz2, .tbz2, .tbz, .tar.xz, .txz

        * Tarball files from tarlz(1).  Supported extensions: .tar.lz,
          .tlz

        * Zip files from unzip(1).  Supported extensions: .zip, .ZIP

        * Gzip files from gzip(1).  Supported extensions: .gz, .Z

        * Bzip2 files from bzip2(1).  Supported extension: .bz2

        * Lzip files from lzip(1).  Supported extension: .lz

        * Xz files from xz(1).  Supported extension: .xz

'4'
     File empty, not regular, or expected.

     Commonly, it is expected:

        * An argument for the mode of operation.

        * A readable file or directory.

        * A binary package (.tlz).

        * A valid recipe.

        * An order file (.order).

        * A protocol supported by the network downloader tool.

        * A checksum file (.sha256).

'5'
     Empty or not defined variable:

     This code is used to report empty or undefined variables; usually,
     variables coming from a recipe or assigned arrays that are tested.

'6'
     Package already installed:

     The package directory for an incoming .tlz package already exists.

'10'
     Network manager error:

     This code is used if the network downloader tool fails for some
     reason.
