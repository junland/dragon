description="
Standalone fortify source implementation.

This is a standalone implementation of fortify source.  It provides
compile time buffer checks.  It is libc-agnostic and simply overlays
the system headers by using the #include_next extension found in GCC.
It was initially intended to be used on musl based GNU/Linux
distributions.
