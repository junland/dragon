description="
A set of tools that assist applications for desktop integration tasks.

xdg-utils is a set of tools that allows applications to easily
integrate with the desktop environment of the user, regardless
of the specific desktop environment that the user runs.

About half of the tools focus on tasks commonly required during
the installation of a desktop application and the other half
focuses on integration with the desktop environment while the
application is running.
