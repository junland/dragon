Extra utilities to complement Musl.

This package includes the following utilities:
getconf, getent, and iconv.

The code is derived from software contributed to The NetBSD Foundation,
mostly rewritten to be used in musl-compatible systems by Timo Teras.

The implementation of the iconv utility was written by Rich Felker.
