description="
A practical and user-friendly package manager.

Qi provides operating modes for build, install, remove, upgrade,
and inspect software packages.

Qi produces software packages using recipe names (also known as
"ports"); in this case, simple text files that contain shell
instructions.

Qi has been written to make use of Graft, a symlink utility to
keep your packages under a single directory hierarchy, it was inspired
by both Depot (Carnegie Mellon University) and Stow (Bob Glickstein).
