description="
Extra utilities and headers to complement Musl.

A set of headers and small utilities for use on musl libc systems,
for providing some minimal glibc compatibility.

The code is derived from software contributed to The NetBSD Foundation,
mostly rewritten to be used in musl-compatible systems by Timo Teras.

The implementation of the iconv utility was written by Rich Felker.
